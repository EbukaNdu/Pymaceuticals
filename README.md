We Study investigated several drug regimens, including Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin, among others.
These regimens were administered to different groups of mice to assess their efficacy in tumor treatment.
Data Analysis:

Data preparation involved merging the mouse metadata and study results datasets into a single DataFrame.
Duplicate data points were identified and removed to ensure data integrity.
Summary statistics, including mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of tumor volume, were calculated for each drug regimen.
Visualizations such as bar charts and pie charts were created to illustrate the distribution of data across different categories and treatment groups.
Quartiles, outliers, and box plots were used to analyze the distribution of final tumor volumes for each treatment regimen.
Line plots and scatter plots were generated to visualize trends and relationships between variables such as tumor volume, time, and mouse weight.
Correlation coefficients and linear regression models were calculated to quantify relationships between variables.
Key Findings:

Some drug regimens showed promising results in reducing tumor volume, while others may have had limited effectiveness or potential adverse effects.
Capomulin and Ramicane appeared to be more effective in reducing tumor volume compared to Infubinol and Ceftamin.
There was a noticeable correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume, suggesting that heavier mice tended to have larger tumors.
The study provided valuable insights into the efficacy of different drug regimens and factors influencing tumor response in mice.
Implications and Future Directions:

The findings of the study could inform further research on tumor treatment strategies and drug development.
Future studies may explore additional factors affecting tumor response, such as genetic markers, environmental factors, and treatment duration.
The dataset and analysis methods employed in this study could serve as a foundation for future research in oncology and preclinical drug testing.
