This study investigated several drug regimens, including Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin, among others.
These regimens were administered to different groups of mice to assess their efficacy in tumor treatment.
The results:
Some drug regimens showed promising results in reducing tumor volume, while others may have had limited effectiveness or potential adverse effects.
Capomulin and Ramicane appeared to be more effective in reducing tumor volume compared to Infubinol and Ceftamin.
There was a noticeable correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume, suggesting that heavier mice tended to have larger tumors.
This could inform further research on tumor treatment strategies and drug development.
Future studies may explore additional factors affecting tumor response, such as genetic markers, environmental factors, and treatment duration.

i referenced our class notes as well as expert learning and chatgpt for help on this assignment as this was one of the harder challenges we've had so far.
